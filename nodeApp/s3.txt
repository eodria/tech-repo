Amazon S3 is a simple data storage service which is highly scalable. Amazon S3 uses the same infrustructure that Amazon uses for its e-commerce market. Developers and companies can save major costs since you only pay what you use for. It also is efficient to integrate Amazon S3 with software applications since it reduces memory usage. I used Amazon S3 to store all the pictures and logos you see on my website. Click here for further documentation
