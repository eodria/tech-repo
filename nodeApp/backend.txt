I connected my front-end server to the back-end server of my web application. This back-end server is responsible for many things such as: 
Captcha verification requests (proving you are not a robot =] ) 
Email and phone number validation on Contact page
Email functionality
Serving all the pages and content to the client (i.e. you)
Website search functionality
Database management
