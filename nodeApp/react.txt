React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces. It was created by Facebook and is currently one of the hottest front-end tools in web development today. It efficiently re-renders changes on websites whenever state/data changes. Since React works in terms of components, engineers can quickly and efficiently build their user interfaces. The entire front-end of my website is made with React. I also use React in my full-time job to connect my back-end services. Click here for further documentation.
