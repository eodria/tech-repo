Node.js is an open-source server environment which runs code outside of the web browser. Node.js allows developers to efficiently create web applications, servers, API's and libraries. Node.js is asynchronous which means higher performance and speed for my website; as soon as my back-end server receives a request it is ready to handle another. I implemented my back-end server in the Node.js environment to efficiently handle all requests coming from the client (i.e. you). Node.js is highly portable and runs on Windows, MacOS, Unix and Linux. Click here for further documentation
